- hold mouse to fire *

- destroy bullet at the edge of the canvas *
  - Accomplished by removing the object when it exits the canvas

- destroy enemies on collision (script this for one part since enemies will follow paths)

- fix how the ship is fast as fuck boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

- add player1 weaponCount to increase the amount of projetiles a player fires *


- user weapon count in some meaningful way with power ups
- make powerup placeholders for when projectile gets built

- make projectile offset so they do not all fire from the same place *
  - delegated spawn location in weaponLocation array

- update speed by creation and velocity for setInterval on the bullet creation

- change the way firing sound effects are generated to dynamically choose per character
  also, so sounds can vary beyond a single effect
- record more sound effects
- When player gets weapon powerup, draw addtion on ship to right, then left 
- firing by holding down mouse button, then letting go and clicking again fires 2 shots
  in quick succession. Do I care?

- should click firerate be accelerated slightly compared to holding (like 700 for hold and 650 for clicking)?
